A note about rsyslogd
All of the above logs are generated using rsyslogd service. It is a system utility providing support for message logging.
Support of both internet and unix domain sockets enables this utility to support both local and remote logging. 
You can view its config file by tying the following command:
# vi /etc/rsyslog.conf
# ls /etc/rsyslog.d/
In short /var/log is the location where you should find all Linux logs file.
However, some applications such as httpd have a directory within /var/log/ for their own log files.
You can rotate log file using logrotate software and monitor logs files using logwatch software.
